It can move forward, backward, left, right, turn, sidesway, etc. What's more, you can develop it secondly, the driver board reserve servos interface can control the robot arm, can control the self-driving robot after adding a gyroscope because it can drive encoder motor.
note:The new version of the driver board corresponds to the schematic diagram, pin 26 27 needs to be modified to A4 A5
